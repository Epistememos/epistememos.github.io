<h1>Canadian Finance Starter Pack</h1>
    <p>If you’re reading this, you’re probably thinking about investing your money. Good choice. Let’s skip the small talk and get to the good stuff.</p>
    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is a starter pack, not a deep dive into every financial term or product. It’s also not financial advice—don’t come at me. I am not a financial advisor or CPA/CFA and all financial investments are subject to market risks.

    <h2>Financial Products</h2>
    <p>What can you actually invest in?</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stocks/Shares:</strong> This is a slice of a company (equity). If you don’t know what stocks are, stop here and do a quick Google search. You’ll hear terms like <em>common</em> or <em>preferred</em> shares—it doesn’t really matter unless you’re playing big and want financial or voting rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Options:</strong> This is a financial derivative that gives you the <em>right</em> (but not the <em>obligation</em>) to buy or sell something at a specific price (strike price) by a specific date (expiration date). Learn this properly before diving in, or you’ll regret it.</li>
        <li><strong>Futures:</strong> Futures are like options’ serious older sibling. They’re contracts obligating you to buy or sell an asset at a set price on a specific date. No backing out unless you close the contract before it expires.</li>
        <li><strong>Bonds:</strong> Bonds = playing banker. You lend money to an issuer (e.g., a company or government), and they pay you regular interest (coupon payments). At maturity, you get back the money you lent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are other products out there, but these are the most common ones you’ll come across.</p>

    <h2>Account Types</h2>
    <p>You’ll need an account to hold and trade your investments.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Individual Account:</strong> Basic, no-frills account. 50% of your profits are taxed (This DOES not mean that the government takes 50% of your profits, it means that 50% of your profits are considered as income and taxed according to the bracket they fall into). You can write off losses. It's great for flexibility—you can invest as much as you want and withdraw whenever. I use this as the account I put money in that I want to easily access for the next 5 years.</li>
        <li><strong>TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account):</strong> My personal favorite. You invest after-tax dollars (so you already got taxed on the money you put in), but your profits are tax-free. Annual contribution limit: ~$6,000. If you’re good at investing, this is where you make tax-free gains.</li>
        <li><strong>RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan):</strong> Contributions lower your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed. You usually withdraw when you’re retired and earning less, so, that way, you get taxed less. Annual contribution limit: 18% of last year’s income (up to ~$32,000). It's perfect for long-term growth and reducing your tax bill.</li>
        <li><strong>FHSA (First Home Savings Account):</strong> New and super useful if you’re buying your first home. Contributions are tax-deductible, and profits are tax-free if used for a home. The rules for contributions can get messy, so look this up if you’re serious. Also, you can transfer the FHSA into an RRSP if you don't end up buying a home.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Brokers</h2>
    <p>A broker is your gateway to the market. Back when I wasn't born, you'd need to call brokers and ask them to place an order for you. Nowadays, you can just have an online brokerage platform do it for you. They charge commissions on your orders and conversion fees for some of them.</p>
    <p>For Canadians, <strong>Interactive Brokers (IBKR)</strong> is my go-to, especially if you’re trading U.S. stocks because you don't need to pay 1.5% conversion fees for every order you place. Other solid options include Wealthsimple, Questrade, Webull, or even your bank. IBKR is my top pick for its low fees and great platform.</p>

    <h2>Common Strategies</h2>
    <p>How much of your life do you want to dedicate to investing?</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Keep It Simple:</strong> If you’re not trying to break your head over it, just buy <strong>SPY</strong>, an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 (500 largest U.S. companies). If you’re feeling adventurous, add some long-term calls (options) on SPY to leverage your returns. But seriously—learn options before diving in, or you’ll blow your account.</li>
        <li><strong>Feeling a Little Riskier?</strong> Do your homework and pick companies you think will outperform the market. For example, if you believe GPU demand is going to skyrocket, consider NVIDIA (NVDA). Just don’t get carried away—stick to trends and solid reasoning. Also, protip, if something is popular or has a nice popular product, it doesn't mean the stock will go up. You are trying to guess if the expectations for the company you invest in are getting exceeded or not, because the market price is based on investors' expectations backed by financials.</li>
        <li><strong>Important note:</strong> It's good to know that there are analysts whose job is to come up with strategies that they think will outperform the market. So, keep in mind that you are competing against teams of people that are more knowledgeable. Personally, I feel like those people are almost as clueless as a retail investor unless they got insider information. In fact, they often underperform the market...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Want to know how much your money would have grown if invested into SPY? You can use this calculator: <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/sp500-calculator/" target="_blank">https://ofdollarsanddata.com/sp500-calculator/</a>.</p>
    <p>Notice how you won't turn 1$ into 1M$? But if you invest 200k$, you might find yourself with another 200k$ in a few years. That's how the long game works. And, if you do that for a few generations using trust entities, you end up with Trust Fund Babies.</p>

    <h2>Common Pitfalls</h2>
    <p>Your biggest enemy in investing? <strong>Yourself. It's not the big hedge funds, it's not the government, it's really just you making horrible investment decisions and not realizing it. So here's a few of the pitfalls you might fall into.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Not Taking Profits:</strong> When your investment works out, don’t let greed convince you to hold on forever. Stocks go up and down, and if you don’t lock in profits, you might watch them vanish. This happens often with non-disciplined investors, they're in it to get a quick buck, but they don't understand it's a long consistency game. Don't be greedy. This whole trading thing is about controlling your greed.</li>
        <li><strong>Getting Attached:</strong> Your stocks are investments, not friends. If you find yourself <em>believing</em> in a stock like it’s your favorite team, take a step back. Emotions have no place in investing. This is especially true with smaller sized companies. I hear some retail investors tell me they hold this particular stock just because they trust in it? But they do not even know who manages the company or how it operates. It sounds ridiculous, but it happens very often.</li>
        <li><strong>Trusting Social Media:</strong> If someone on TikTok or Twitter is hyping a stock, it’s probably too late to invest—or worse, it’s a scam. Think about it this way: Are there any incentives for the people sharing that information with you that would benefit them? If the answer is yes, is this done at your detriment? Probably the answer is yes again. Also, be weary of your own research, there are plenty of missleading headlines out there. </li>
        <li><strong>Gambling Mindset:</strong> Investing can feel exciting, but don’t turn it into a casino. Stick to what you understand, or you’ll burn through your money faster than you think. I've seen plenty of young people burn through their savings by deciding to gamble it all on some option that ends up expiring worthless. It's super easy to blow up your savings and lose all the work you've put in.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Investing isn’t rocket science. Open an account (or a few), deposit money, and buy financial products. The hardest part? Being patient and staying disciplined. If you manage your risk and keep a cool head, your money will grow—just give it time.</p>
    <p>Good luck out there.</p>

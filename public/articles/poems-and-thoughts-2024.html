<h2>Boxing Thoughts</h2>
<p> I'm probably going to write a full article on this next year. <br /> This year, I picked up boxing. I had done 4-5 months before the pandemic, got to my first sparring and then the pandemic hit. Back then, I wanted to clash on a ring and see how tough I was. I went back to boxing this January with a similar desire. I did a few weeks at the McGill boxing club and liked it so much that I joined back my old gym in March. Then, that gym closed its doors permanently a month in. Old me probably would have stopped right there. But, I had yet to see how tough I was. I joined the best gym in MTL (Pound4Pound) and things quickly picked up. A month in, I had sparred multiple times and even faced a professional boxer for 2 rounds (He dropped me with two liver shots and I got a taste of how tough I really was üòä). A few months in at my new gym and I now have 3 victories under my belt. Now, the story is a set up for the point I wanna explain. Boxing is this vile, brutal, dirty struggle to many, it's an art to a few and something in between for the rest. To me, boxing is about the philosophy of fighting. In my day to day, I never have to worry about getting hurt or losing or anything if I don't take risks. The daily life is a quiet fight that is lost through innaction and passivity (if you don't do anything, you lose). There's no one out there who will come out to kick your ass. If something bad happens to you, it's because you were collateral damage. Meanwhile, your opponent in boxing is out to get you, wether it is personal or not. The struggle in boxing is vivid and direct; you have to fear and stress before entering that ring and facing your opponent. And so, I was able to transpose those feelings into my daily life, making my experiences much more vivid. I understand now that not fufilling my ambitions isn't a lack of victory, it's a loss. I also gained tremendous amount of good confidence. I was always confident in myself and my abilities, but I didn't want to showcase that because I associated confidence to arrogance. Boxing allowed me to navigate the nuance between arrogance and confidence to the point where I could assert myself in a way that feels right. Boxing is hard, it's rough, it will often make you uncomfortable, but if you're serious about it (like for any fighting sport), you'll know yourself better. You will really see how tough you are. If you can, take a trial class at a serious gym. Look at the people in there. I can guarantee you that you will be impressed by the resilience of those warriors. </p>
<h2> Reading a waste of time? </h2>
<p> Reading is boring <br />
    Half the time, I'm snoring </p>
<p> I find that reading (manuals, novels, any type of non-summarized literature) for the sake of attaining knowledge is a waste of time. I might do it as a hobby from time to time, but I never get that much knowledge through reading a book. The only thing I find worth reading for the sake of absorbing knowledge are summaries or notes. Books, articles, manuals, they all have too much fluff to them. Some might argue that reading is good because it makes you spend time on trying to understand what you are reading. But, time spent reading is much better spent applying the knowledge you just saw or even teaching it to someone. </p>
<p> Now, reading as a hobby is different, but I also find it very boring.I used to read a lot of classics. During high school, I would devour books while commuting. It felt good to tell myself that I was reading what people considered the epitome of literature. But, at a certain point, stories got repetitive, what people attribute to genius seemed like common sense. Sure, it's an art, but it wasn't so deep... Also, I hated when some authors would go on fancy 4 pages descriptions about some character's outfit or something. Like I get it, this man looks distinguished and miserable like most of the other characters but this one limps because something about his past unables him to walk like others and he must always rely on his cane to go forward... I tried other styles, sometimes the plot is worth it, like "Flowers for Algernon", sometimes, I just leave the book halfway read because it bores me too much. <br /> ...

<h2>Le D√©sert Aride</h2>
<p> Dans un d√©sert aride, errait le Chevalier. <br />
De son dextre livide, trainait son bouclier, <br />
Fuyant l'odeur putride des combats pass√©s, <br />
O√π maints liberticides y furent execut√©s. <br /> 
<br />
Noble,succombant √† l'hubris des ministres, <br />
L'√©p√©e de fer trancha son senestre sinistre. <br />
Conqu√©rant les dunes tel un alpiniste. <br />
Dans le temps mort de l'ennui fataliste, <br />
Le Chevalier devenu alchimiste.  <br />
<br />
Qu'est devenu le Chevalier? <br />
Le vent entendu dire qu'encore il errait. <br />
Mais le vent est euph√©miste, il cache la verit√©. <br />
<br />
Dans un d√©sert aride, gisait un chevalier. <br />
De son dextre livide, plus rien n'y trainait. <br />

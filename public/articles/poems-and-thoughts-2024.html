<h2> Reading a waste of time? </h2>
<p> Reading is boring <br />
    Half the time, I'm snoring </p>
<p> I find that reading (manuals, novels, any type of non-summarized literature) for the sake of attaining knowledge is a waste of time. I might do it as a hobby from time to timebut I never get that much knowledge through reading a book. The only thing I find worth reading for the sake of absorbing knowledge are summaries or notes. Books, articles, manuals, they all have too much fluff to them. Some might argue that reading is good because it makes you spend time on trying to understand what you are reading. But, time spent reading is much better spent applying the knowledge you just saw or even teaching it to someone. </p>
<p> Now, reading as a hobby is different, but I also find it very boring.I used to read a lot of classics. During high school, I would devour books while commuting. It felt good to tell myself that I was reading what people considered the epitome of literature. But, at a certain point, stories got repetitive, what people attribute to genius seemed like common sense. Sure, it's an art, but it wasn't so deep... Also, I hated when some authors would go on fancy 4 pages descriptions about some charactersoutfit or something. Like I get it, this man looks distinguished and miserable like most of your other characters but this one limps because something about his past unables him walk like other peopleand he must always rely on his cane to go forward... I tried other styles, sometimes the plot is worth it, like "Flowers for Algernon", sometimes, I just leave the book halfway read because it bores me too much. <br /> ...

<h2>Le Désert Aride</h2>
<p> Dans un désert aride, errait le Chevalier. <br />
De son dextre livide, trainait son bouclier, <br />
Fuyant l'odeur putride des combats passés, <br />
Où maints liberticides y furent executés. <br /> 
<br />
Noble,succombant à l'hubris des minitres, <br />
L'épée de fer trancha son senestre sinistre. <br />
Conquérant les dunes tel un alpiniste. <br />
Dans le temps mort de l'ennui fataliste, <br />
Le Chevalier devenu alchimiste.  <br />
<br />
Qu'est devenu le Chevalier? <br />
Le vent entendu dire qu'encore il errait. <br />
Mais le vent est euphémiste, il cache la verité. <br />
<br />
Dans un désert aride, gisait un chevalier. <br />
De son dextre livide, plus rien n'y trainait. <br />
